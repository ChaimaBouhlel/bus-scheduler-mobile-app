# Bus Arrival Tracker

## Overview

Bus Arrival Tracker is a simple Android application designed to showcase the implementation of key Android development concepts, including Room database, ListAdapter, MVVM architecture, LiveData, fragments, and Jetpack Compose's Navigation component. The primary purpose of the application is to display bus arrival times from a pre-filled database and, subsequently, to show specific arrival times for the selected bus station.

## Features

- **Room Database:** Utilizes Room for efficient management of the database.

- **ListAdapter:** Implements ListAdapter for optimized data presentation in a RecyclerView.

- **MVVM Architecture:** Adheres to the MVVM architecture pattern for clean separation of concerns.

- **LiveData:** Leverages LiveData for reactive data storage and observation, ensuring up-to-date UI representation.

- **Fragments:** Incorporates fragments for modular UI components, enhancing code organization.

- **Jetpack Compose Navigation:** Implements navigation using Jetpack Compose's Navigation component for a seamless user experience.
